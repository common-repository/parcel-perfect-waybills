== Requirements: == 

 * Parcel Perfect API uses cm and kg for product dimensions and weight.  Ideally set Woocommerce to use the same.
 
== Package Customization: == 
   
 * Go to the Parcel Perfect tab on the left hand side of the Wordpress admin dashboard 
 * This section is used to package items together.  In other words if you would like to box 6 items for delivery you can specify it here.   
 * Rules can be set up for each shipping class that have been set up.    
 * Click 'Add package' and select the shipping class you would like to create a rule for. Select 'Default - no shipping class' to set up a rule for all products not part of a shipping class.
 * Select the maximum amount of items per box.   
 * For each line between 1 and maximum amount of items per box, please specify the label for that amount of items as well as the dimensions.  For example, the box size might be different when 3 items were boxed compared to when 5 were boxed.  Each variation of item amount can be set here.
